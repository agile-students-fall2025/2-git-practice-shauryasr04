**Article Title**: Meta is Allowing AI in Job Interviews


## Summary
This article discusses the idea of Meta allowing AI software in the use of coding interviews they use to screen candidates. I find this article very interesting because I find the software engineering process to be a very tough process, and I wonder now these changes will affect the recruiting landscape as a whole. Will more companies adapt this same method or will this blow up in Meta's face? 

I have this second thought mainly because of how AI is perceived as cheating tool in coding interviews. There are many startups and private software companies that give such AI-leveraged software that can help students cheat in coding interviews to help land very prestigious, high paying jobs. I wonder whether allowing AI will help control that aspect of the recruiting process or whether it will serve as a catalyst of a bigger problem.

I thought your summary was very good and the topic can be applied to school as well. I wonder how professors/teachers will start to incorporate AI into their learning now that it is being used by these big corporations.
